# Three-Way Decision Support System for Uncertainty

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a three-way decision support system that categorizes decision alternatives into **acceptance**, **non-commitment**, and **rejection** sets using advanced concepts like **Dempster-Shafer Theory**, **Prospect Theory**, and **Kernel Density Estimation**. The proposed system is designed to handle uncertainty in decision-making scenarios and is benchmarked against traditional machine learning models.

## Key Features
- Implements a three-way decision-making framework to handle uncertain scenarios using Dempster-Shafer Theory and Prospect Theory.
- Leverages **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** for target model generation.
- Benchmarks the proposed model against traditional machine learning algorithms, including:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Tested on 10 real-world datasets from the **UCI Repository**, such as Breast Cancer, Hepatitis, Thyroid, and Fertility datasets.

## Performance
The proposed model outperformed the average accuracy of traditional machine learning models on **9 out of 10 datasets**, demonstrating superior performance in classification tasks under uncertainty. The full results and comparison with traditional methods are available in the published paper.

## Publication
The research has been published in the journal *Knowledge and Information Systems (Springer)*. The full publication can be accessed at:
